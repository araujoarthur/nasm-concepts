    sub rsp, 16 ; Reserves 16 bytes. Remember 16 here is decimal as there is no further indications. Could be 0x10 (because the sequence 10 in base b is always = b in decimal)

    lea rdi, [rsp] ; lea is the instruction load effective address (intel AIO manual page 1193 as of June's 2025 version). Loads the address of the value in the RSP address (thus [rsp] and not just rsp)
    ; the above line is the same as lea rdi, rsp because 'lea' does not dereference the memory operand. it just takes the address of RSP (taking the effective address)
    ; as the effective address is the result of a computation of [base + index * scale + displacement], and there's no such computation in the line above, it just takes the effective address of rsp.
    ; Then the destination index register (rdi) holds the address of the buffer.
